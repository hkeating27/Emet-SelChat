Do you have any idea how much you have delayed the Rejoining? Following the Flood, the First had been listing ever further towards the Light─towards stasis. The end was in sight! Enter man and his indomitable spirit. He would haul the world back from the brink! And adding his lumpen weight to the power of growth, he duly tipped the scales, if only by a fraction. Yet a fraction was enough to spoil the perfect imbalance needed to bring about a Rejoining! Had mankind continued to live in idleness under Vauthry's rule, all the conditions would have been met... But you had to come and ruin it all! Thanks to your meddling, Light's supremacy is in doubt, and our painstakingly laid plans are in tatters!"

Look, it did cross my mind to simply side with Vauthry and kill you all. But that's no different from what Lahabrea did. And we all know how well that ended for him.

Now then, if I'm to fetch her for you, I will require a suitable place to work. We must find somewhere that resonates strongly with the Lifestream. And by we, I mean you. To that end, I give you this─an aetherial lamp of my own design. Keep it close as you venture out into the woods. The brighter the glow, the stronger the location's resonance with the Lifestream.

Oh, if I had a gil for every time one of you heroes made that claim... Says the arch Bringer of Chaos. Ah hah hah! Flattery will get you nowhere, my dear. But seriously, we Ascians do what we do for the greater good. For the Rejoining. Though we may sow the seeds of chaos, it is man who tends them, he who reaps their bountiful harvest.

Are there any other Ascians here in the First? Not a single one. Happily, I am quite content to mingle with the masses. And even if I did crave the company of my own kind, one might say we're understaffed at present. There are no strict rules governing how we work, though that has not been without its consequences. In the beginning, we were each responsible for a shard, and free to do as we wished, but Igeyorhm's impetuous temperament showed us the folly in that. In light of her failings, we took to working in tandem as the situation demanded. Mitron and Loghrif were supposed to take care of the First, of course. Alas, they were slain by the champions of this realm shortly before the Flood. Expendable though they were, I found them quite useful. But that is a tale for another time. Actually, I...don't.

And in the end...Hydaelyn was victorious. With all Her strength She smote Him─dealing a blow so devastating that it split the very fabric of reality. And thus was Zodiark banished and His being divided. That concludes today's lesson on long-forgotten history. Though I imagine your Mother would offer a rather contradictory account. As is Her wont."

And like one of your primals, He tempered us. It was only natural. There is no resisting such power. And so we Ascians came to exist solely to bring about the rule of darkness. His darkness. Of course, some would call us “evil” for it...and they would be fools. Though that is only to be expected, given their innate inability to conceive of the nature of our universe. ...But I believe I am repeating myself. Do you not trust me to speak honestly?

In the distant past, when the world was one and whole, a great calamity threatened all life. It began without warning. The very laws of the star were warped and broken, and chaos swiftly spread throughout the land. Faced with annihilation, we sought to imbue the star with its own will. Thus was Zodiark born, and by His power was order restored. Ere long, however, thankless fools began to fear that Zodiark's might was too great.

This singular ability strikes not at such banal things as flesh, but everything that defines the target, diluting its existence. For example, were She to strike you... Two individuals, identical in appearance, yet reduced in all respects. Strength, intelligence, the soul itself─all is halved. Do you see? This selfsame fate befell not only Zodiark, but the very star. Only three were fortunate enough to escape the sundering─me being one of them. When I beheld the shattered remnants of our home, I knew deepest despair. The inhabitants of these fourteen fragments were feeble, frail, and foolish. Oblivious to their imperfection, ignorant of their past. Malformed creatures thrashing blindly about. Pitiful. Disturbing. Depressing. So we took it upon ourselves to rejoin the worlds. But in our eagerness─and, I confess, our ignorance─we erred, and made a useless void of the Thirteenth. It was only afterwards that we discovered a connection 'twixt Source and shard─a flow of energy that maintains elemental balance. And thus did we arrive at our time-honored modus operandi."

Why, their very beings were divided into fourteen, of course. Yet by our power, we unsundered Ascians may raise up one of their fragments to their original office. Ah, but I suppose this in itself bears explaining. So...the names by which you know us are not, in fact, our names. Be it Elidibus or Lahabrea or Igeyorhm, all are titles of office. And when an office is vacated, it may be filled by another. Over the eons, I have overseen several changings of the guard among our sundered brethren. And in such instances, the vacant title ordinarily goes to another fragment of the selfsame soul. While it is by no means impossible to raise up wholly unrelated individuals, 'tis we whose fervent entreaties brought forth Lord Zodiark─whose souls He claimed in the beginning─who make the truest servants. What will you say? So, if we were to defeat all the Ascians of the Source... Then none would remain to raise up new Ascians, and our kind would eventually fade from existence. You would like that, wouldn't you? Well, feel free to dream─'tis no crime to do so. What is your true name, then? Hm! There may come a day when I reveal my true name to you─but this is not it.

Whatsoever may await us, when thou takest those final steps, I pray that it shall be with a smile upon thy face. The View from Above Urianger is wearing a pensive look.

        "output": "Would you look at that? The citizens of Eulmore engaging in what can only be described as “manual labor.” Who would have thought it possible? Do you know the most reliable way to deal with those who stubbornly refuse to see reason? You conquer them─crush them under heel. Such was the trusted method of Allag, and one still favored by Garlemald. But conquest is the easy part. The true challenge begins once the dust has settled─quenching the glowing embers of animosity and maintaining a semblance of peace. This requires the conqueror to treat the conquered with dignity, and the conquered to let bygones be bygones. A difficult feat to achieve. But you have achieved just that...to my considerable surprise. It's a compliment. Take it. Ahh, the vibrant energy that fills the air when like-minded souls gather. To think back on that time before time fair brings a tear to the eye. What? You thought ancient beings like us incapable of crying? Well, rest assured that if your heart can be broken, then so can mine! Back when the world was whole, we had family, friends, loves... Men knew peace and contentment, and with our adamant souls, we could live for an age. There was no conflict born of want or disparity. Our differences paled into insignificance next to all we had in common. And then there was Amaurot... Never was a city more magnificent. From the humblest streets to the highest spires, she fairly gleamed... Not that you would remember any of this. What will you say? “Remember”? Is this story going anywhere? Never mind. The point is: the world of old was a far better place than what we have now. I believe you would like it, having witnessed the things you have. Remember, you are of the Source. Unlike the halfmen here, you stand only to gain. Should you survive the remaining calamities, you will become our equal. A complete existence in a complete world. But such talk is a pleasure for later. Back to work, hero. Ah, there was one thing I had meant to ask. How well do you know the Exarch? Has he ever deigned to show you what hides beneath the cowl? What, never ? Even to you? How very interesting... I shall enjoy working out what it means. Until next time."

Hm, you still retain your form and your senses...but you have all but become a sin eater. Whether you will it or no, your mere existence will serve to engulf the world in Light. Those in your company will likewise turn into sin eaters, and in time you will succumb to your base instincts and hunt innocents to feast on their sweet, sweet aether. Those few with the will left to fight may rise up against you. But before your absolute might, they will quickly know despair. “There is no hope! We are finished!

The wisdom that man guards may open up new worlds of possibilities. He has unlocked the secrets of travel across the rift─and through time as well, it would seem. Quite an accomplishment for one of his “incomplete” nature. I must explore the limits of his capabilities, and harness that power for the Ardor. Even now, after everything, you refuse to see reason.

I have broken bread with you, fought with you, grown ill, grown old! Sired children and yes, welcomed death's sweet embrace. For eons have I measured your worth and found you wanting! Too weak and feeble-minded to serve as stewards of any star! Have your recent spats with Vauthry and his sin eaters taught you nothing? Have you not learned that your ignorance and frailty beget only endless misery? How long do you mean to perpetuate this farce? How much more must I endure your bumbling interference? Let us imagine that the laws of reality are again undone, and the world faces true annihilation. Do you honestly believe that half your number would sacrifice themselves to save the other?

You need to revert them to their constituent aether first. Lest you wonder why I asked for two species, it is due to the difference in their aetheric balance. Blending them allows us to produce garb with superior aetheric stability. Won't someone be angry with us for using those creatures? Oh it's fine, there's no one around to tell us off.

According to his profile, he has short, dark hair. So you know, it's because we're in Elpis that we don't have our cowls up. A special exemption due to the need to be aware of dangerous creatures. Elsewhere, we do not exhibit our individuality. It's unseemly. This is all common sense, but I would not assume you possess any."

Only a select few may be privy to such knowledge, and that does not include someone who cannot or will not divulge their origins. What? Will I have to remove you by force? What will you say? I have important things to say to him as well. Yes, I'm sure your business with Hermes is quite pressing. You may speak with him to your heart's content—after ours is concluded.

As one who does not know you personally, I am to use my impartial eye to take your measure. And above all else, to ascertain your disposition towards the invitation.

In our finite time upon it, 'tis our duty to make it a better place, that all who call it home now and in future may abide in happiness. To that end, we have dedicated ourselves to the pursuit of enlightened creation. And by our efforts did we transform this once-untamed wilderness into the peaceful paradise you enjoy today. To return to the star whence we came is a privilege afforded to we who have so loved and nurtured it. A choice embraced by those who have lived their lives to the fullest, in service to our world. And when they depart upon this journey, it is beautiful. Always.",

Or so the majority of us hold. Some few have elected to eschew custom. Mayhap you feel Fandaniel's deeds do not warrant his return. Yet you should know his accomplishments as well as any. During his time, he conceived of countless outstanding concepts. And channeling the wealth of experience he attained here in Elpis, he brought forth many new specimens."

If it can see its observation period to the end without issue, we shall release it unto the world. Tell me─do you know the difference between living beings and arcane entities? It is the presence of a soul. Yet the soul isn't something you can choose to have at will. No, it manifests only in those beings whose forms adhere to the laws of creation. That can endure on their own. Beings that do not fulfill this requirement, such as those spontaneously born of magic or natural phenomena, do not have souls. No matter how much it might resemble flora or fauna, if it lacks a soul, then it is considered an arcane entity. So you see, it is not for mankind to decide what is living. That domain lies beyond our manipulation, and it is hubris to assume otherwise. But come, let us head to the nearby beacon. I've received a report that arcane entities have gathered there.",

    },
    {
        "input": "Hardly surprising. Dynamis cannot be seen, much less felt. And though its existence has long been theorized, we had no proof until the flower's serendipitous creation. What's more, dynamis is far weaker than aether. Under normal circumstances, its effects are drowned out by the latter. On account of which, beings comprised of and reliant upon aether, like you and I, are unable to make practical use of dynamis. 'Tis a truly esoteric thing, known to but a select few scholars.",

        "output": "I think not. Your nature remains a mystery, but ere I reinforced you, you appeared to be little more than a common familiar─and a faded one at that. Well, I have been known to transcend my limits with nothing but determination. That sounds more akin to the desperate flailings of a wild beast when facing imminent death. If I'm thin, it's because Emet-Selch didn't do a proper job. Well, aren't we ungrateful? Mayhap I should revert you to the pathetic, faded thing you were."

That personal annoyance aside, Hermes's knowledge is undeniably impressive. Given that there are none among the Fourteen who specialize in the celestial, he would be a welcome addition. Assuming he can be persuaded to join, that is. I still can't understand his hesitation... What will you say? Why did you join the Convocation? What do you specialize in?"

The Convocation of Fourteen is a governing body that determines myriad policies. Our goal is to ensure that all is right in creation, that our star may know a brighter future. As the name suggests, the council is comprised of fourteen offices, each of which is held by an individual chosen for their surpassing abilities. Depending on the office, one is required to either be an authority in a certain field, or possess skills that would facilitate the performance of their stipulated duties. The former category includes Mitron, specialist in aquatic life; Loghrif, specialist in terrestrial life and husbandry... Halmarut, specialist in fungal and plant life; Emmerololth, specialist in medicine and healing... And Lahabrea, specialist in creation magicks, who has brought forth phantom beings of the highest complexity. As for the latter category, there is Altima, advocate of the arts; Igeyorhm, champion of enlightenment and rhetoric; Pashtarot, preserver of discipline and order... Emet-Selch, keeper of the aetherial realm─or “Underworld” in the vernacular; Fandaniel, pursuer of extant phenomena... And Azem, traveler of the world and counselor to the people. ...What? Should I be revealing such details to you? Don't be silly. Even children know this much, and you would do well to remember it all. Actually...never mind. Then why did you bother me!? <sigh> Honestly, I'm beginning to think you were created for the sole purpose of trying my patience..."

        "input": "What!? Y-You needn't go to such lengths...",
        "output": "You don't know? <sigh> But of course not... Transformation is an art in which one manipulates a vast quantity of aether to construct another body around oneself. In practice, this allows one to assume any conceivable form, and thereby transcend the limits of one's flesh. Yet convenient though it may be, transforming in the presence of others is considered vainglorious in the extreme. As uncouth and unseemly as running about robeless. Shameful. Am I to understand you make a habit of this?"

Seven were created for observation... ...And all seven must be unmade. Doros has followed the correct protocols, and, as chief overseer, I can find no fault in his judgment. The lykaones would disrupt the natural order, ravaging and consuming other species until they themselves starve and perish.

I intend to petition the Bureau of the Architect to have the concept preserved as a restricted-purpose hazardous life-form. Hythlodaeus has pledged to support me in this endeavor.

Now, I warn you: its abilities are as fiery as its temperament. Once it spots you, it will unleash orbs of flame... But fear not. By my measure, you are more than equal to the task. Withstand the onslaught for a few brief moments, and that will give me time to catch it unawares. ...Ready? Then let us begin! A few moments is all I require. Just make sure that you command its attention! Not quite yet! Stand your ground a little longer! Now! Forgive me... Please forgive me... May you and your kin find peace...

Yet never has a departure caused me such grief as Hermes appears to feel. What must it be like to experience such torment...? ...I don't know what answer he's searching for, or if it is within our power to give it.

Now I can focus on your tale without that missing concept nagging at my mind. Have you always had a knack for finding things? What will you say? I've often been asked to do so. Oho! You too? Some of us seem destined to always be searching. For ourselves and for others. Traveling and searching go hand in hand. You travel often, then? It seems we have something in common. Long ago, when I held the seat of Azem, I was forever trekking back and forth across the star in search of answers to people's problems. Naturally, the need for such journeys has lessened considerably since I entrusted the position to my whimsical successor... Yet I am still eager to come running should an old acquaintance or new interest require my personal attention. That is what brings me to Elpis, in fact. Many times has my presence been requested; my opinions sought concerning the habitat of this or that creation. Agreeing to help locate that missing crystal was a minor distraction...which now promises to become a major revelation! How strange and wonderful it is the way one thing leads to another. Wouldn't you agree? A Past, Not Yet Come to Pass Venat is in a cheerful mood. Thank you again for your timely help. Now then, 'tis time I returned this stolen property.

To sacrifice oneself for the star is a noble act, and I would hold those who gave themselves to this Zodiark in the highest esteem. Yet you claim I recreated Amaurot and populated it with phantoms of our people. A bizarre indulgence that would be insulting to their memory. Worse still, I even invited you there─literally invited my own downfall. Why would I do something so idiotic and inexplicable? Now, I will allow that the hypothetical task of restoring our world would be daunting in the extreme. The thought of having to bear such a burden for a thousand thousand lives horrifies me.

In the first Final Days, it warped creation magicks. In the second, it warped the people themselves. The key variable, I suspect, is the aetheric density of the men of each age. As you know, aether, in essence, negates dynamis. Harboring high concentrations of aether, we ancients cannot readily manipulate dynamis─nor be manipulated by it. Therefore, rather than our selves, the calamity affected our magicks. In contrast, having been sundered, the people of the future are composed of but a fraction of our aether.

Still, mild humiliation will be the least of our concerns if we fail to get our hands on Meteion! What will you do? Discuss the water's edge. We should be able to reach the bottom of this drop by climbing down the rocks at the water's edge. Do not even think of dragging me over the falls.

They were conquered. Though they destroyed the enemy in reprisal, they could not regain their former glory. One race had concluded that finite time was the root of all woes. Aspiring to shatter its shackles, they went in search of infinity. They discovered nothing is infinite, and that neither time or death can be cheated. Disillusioned, they gave up on the future─and themselves. One race had discarded all things that gave rise to sorrow, hoping to have only joy. They found joy lost its savor in the absence of sorrow, and lost their will to live. Though worlds apart, these peoples shared a belief. The belief that they had tried their best. That they had tried to fulfill their potential, with every step and success. In the course of which they learned the truth. That they would never be free of fear and sorrow, anger and despair─of loneliness─so long as they yet lived. Even now, their souls cry out for oblivion. And to this song of anguish, I lend my voice. We lend our voice. O beloved mankind, shimmering jewels of beautiful Etheirys... Rejoice, for we will free you from the cruel yoke of existence.

        "output": "A gambit brazen beyond words. Though we've grown accustomed to reckless improvision due to the antics of an incorrigible associate. Though in the case of certain present company, “incorrigible” is an understatement. Honestly, I'm beginning to suspect it's a requirement for every Azem. There's no time! Quickly! Even now, I do not believe your tale. I would not suffer us to walk such a wretched path. Still, if it must be said... Do not squander it. The legacy I leave you."

        "output": "Yes, yes, you do that. Now, if we may tend to Hermes? Whatever this Meteion did, it seems he bore the brunt of it. Once you are fit to travel, you will return with us to Amaurot. We need to make certain there are no other ill effects. Also─I am here on business of the Fourteen. We've already had the conversation, like as not, but since your toy wiped my memory, we'll have to have it again."

There is a theory which holds that memories scoured by blasts of aether are restored when the soul is cleansed in the Underworld. If true, then perhaps when our time comes to return to the star, we shall remember these few days we have lost.",

That being said, we do have a score to settle. So, here I am, Venat. I suppose you needed me to tie it all together, these frayed threads of our history─but knowing you, I suspect there's a joke in it too. Oh yes, I can imagine you gloating over my forgetfulness. Were I feeling charitable, I might assume you had left room for the possibility of this outcome. Even so, you'll get no applause from me. A single gesture will not lighten the burden I've had to bear. Still, you must be commended. Our methods would not have brought mankind this far. And so, as a show of respect to the last of us, I make this declaration. You will not end our journey! That is our answer! The answer of all lives of Etheirys, past and present!"

In the course of your long journey, you will learn from those you meet. Learn to walk and run and so much more. A flower. Yes. Upon your return, I will gift you a beautiful flower.",
        "output": "These Elpis blooms serve as proof that this realm is not utterly devoid of hope. No more can you deny its power. No more is yours the dominion of despair. In case the practical implications were lost on you, your comrades no longer need fight their fight. So, go on. Call them back to your side."

        "output": "Of course. The encore is finished, and I will not suffer myself to live again by Hydaelyn's magick. But more than that, the future you seek is not the past we loved. That is why we fought. And why I lost. But though you defeated me, my ideals are inviolate. Invincible. Spare me your pity. I have no use for it. If you would do something for me─save our star. See this tale to a triumphant conclusion, and with elation in your hearts, bid the final curtain fall. Only then may it rise again and a new tale begin─with new parts for all to play. Tell me, have you been to the ruins beneath the waters of the Bounty? Or the treasure islands beyond the frozen waters of Blindfrost, in Othard's north? The fabled golden cities of the New World? The sacred sites of the forgotten people of the south sea isles? What about Meracydia, the southern continent? Do you know aught of its present state of affairs? ...I thought not. Even of your little Eorzea, you know precious little. The true identities of the Twelve, for instance. All of which is to say: expand your horizons. Go forth and seek discovery. Some of the civilizations in the reflections will surprise you. As the bearer of Azem's crystal, you may consider your duty to see at least that much. I certainly did."

Take a seat, then, and I'll find us something to nibble on as well. It's so much quieter these days without everyone around... ...Not that I'm pining for your return, you understand. I have my sources, and I know that each and every one of you is doing well and keeping busy with your endeavors! Meanwhile, I'm left with a surplus of free time─and the question of how to make the most of it! What about you? Any plans for the immediate future? What will you say? A grand new adventure, of course! Traveling to the edge of existence and back wasn't enough!? Well, if that's the case, I might have a suggestion for you... I'm still mulling it over... I hope you weren't thinking of asking me for advice! Though, if you are open to suggestions, I might have one for you... ... After what you went through, I'm not surprised you need a moment to think. But if you're open to suggestions, I might have one for you... You've fought bravely and selflessly, helping those in need and saving our star from unimaginable threats. For your deeds, you've been hailed as the champion of Eorzea and a host of other incredible things. But why not put those titles aside for a while? Acquit yourself as a simple adventurer again, and travel the world in search of wonder! What will you say? You're right! Who knows what mysteries are still waiting to be discovered? That's the spirit! I can feel from here the blazing fire that just lit in your belly! Now all you need is a destination. If you're having trouble deciding, just leave it to me. That's a great idea. But where to start...? Ahhh, with so many exciting places to choose from, it's hard to narrow it down... But I believe I have the perfect destination in mind. ... If you're having trouble deciding, just leave it to me. Thavnair─that's where you should go next! I doubt you were able to squeeze in a proper tour of Radz-at-Han the last time you were there, what with the burning skies and rampaging monsters and so forth. And I'm sure Vrtra would be pleased to see you! Then there's the Bounty itself. The Empire's presence in the region was always a deterrent to exploration, so if you've a mind to sail that sea, now's your chance. Just think of all the new experiences you could have!",

The fabled golden cities of the New World? Weigh archor now, the tide is high And dawn of new adventure nigh Row forth to break horizon's bond And tread the gilded path beyond!"
